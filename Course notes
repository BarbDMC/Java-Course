Literals are numbers that don't change

ilegal start of expressions

the division in Java return intenger if you divide between two intengers, you need to make one of the numbers a decimal in order to have a decimal result

PRECEDENCE, use parenthesis is a good practice too

/exit

You need to print valid expressions

String Literal => Something btween double quotes

Java is case sensitive

\ => use quotes in a string
\n => new line
\t => print a tab
\\ => print slashes

Math.random()
Math.min()
Math.max()


printf() allows formatting and printing values from expressions using modifiers such as %d that allows to print a math result expression

ex: System.out.print("5 * 2 = %d", 5 * 2).println()

It has to use println method to avoid print the strin stream

%s to print strings

%f to print float

type name = value

Declaration

cannot find symbol
incompatible types

Every variable has a name, value and a memory location in which is stored

Name variables in Java
- CamelCase
- Cannot use hyphens
- Cannot start with a number
- Cannot be a keyword
- No limit on length of identifier
- Can use numbers, letters, $ and, underscore

Primitive data types
- int // 32 bits
- byte //8 bits
- short // 16 nits
- long	// 64 bits
- float // 32 bits not precise
- double // 64 bits not precise, but a little bit more than float
- char // 16 bits, one letter, single quotes
- boolean //true or false'


The compound assignment operator is a shorthand way to perform an arithmetic operation and then assign the result to the variable on the left-hand side of the operator. Example: x += 3;


methods are named with CamelCase too.

/save fileName.txt saves a file with the code created in the Jshell session

/edit methodName Opens a JShell edit path to modify the methods

Methid overloading is to define multiple functions with the same name but a different amount of parameters, needs different quantity of parameters to distinguish with version of the function you're a gonna call
